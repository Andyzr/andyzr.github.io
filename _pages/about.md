I am a data scientist, engineering, at [Google, LLC](https://about.google/).

I have board interests in Ads measurements, digital marketing, causal inference, and machine learning.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Civil Engineering from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was adviserd by [Burcu Akinci](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/akinci/) and [Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). I worked on using causal inference with high-granular observational data to estimate and mitigate work zone impacts on crash risks.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly swimming and running), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family.

Here is my [resume](./assets/pdf/Andy_Zhuoran_Zhang_resume.pdf).
