I am a PhD student in Advanced Infrastructure System Group at Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests lie in the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. My current research project is to mitigate work zone crash risk using causal inference methods based on Potential Outcome Framework and Directed Acyclic Graphs. 

Specifically, my research questions are related to inferring the average and heterogeneous treatment effect with unmeasured confounders (e.g., using Regression Discontinuity Design, instrumental variables, and causal forest), and inferring the controlled direct effect with Rubin's generalized methods (G methods).

Here is my [resume](./assets/pdf/Andy_Zhuoran_Zhang_resume.pdf).
